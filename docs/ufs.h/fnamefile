fnamefile() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
fnamefile - creates a file of mountpoint files and file sizes

Synopsis ---------------

#include "ufs.h"

FILE *fnamefile(const char mountpoint);

Description ------------

The fnamefile() function generates a file that contains a list of files 
contained in the MountPoint specified in mountpoint along with their sizes in
bytes. This file is stored on the specified MountPoint and a pointer to this 
file is then returned.

This function can be used to generated files for performing tasks such as
displaying the contents of the filesystem.

Return Value -----------

Upon successful completion, fnamefile() returns a FILE pointer to the generated
namefile. If no filepointers could be allocated or the disk is full, then NULL
is returned. 

The namefile is formatted in such a way that each file is given 12 bytes of
space. The first 8 bytes are the name of the file. The following 4 bytes are
used for the little-endian 32-bit number of bytes in the size of the file.

The internal pointer for the file will be set to the 0th byte of the file

Errors -----------------

The following conditions will cause NULL to be returned:
+ The mountpoint specified is invalid OR
+ The mountpoint specified is not currently mounted
+ The mountpoint is full and a namefile could not be created
+ All global file filepointers are allocated

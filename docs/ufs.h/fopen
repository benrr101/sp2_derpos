fopen() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
fopen - file pointer open functions

Synopsis ---------------

#include "ufs.h"

FILE *fopen(const char filepath[10]);

Description ------------

The fopen() function opens the file whose path is pointed to be filepath and
allocates a filepointer for reading/writing from the file. If the file does not
exist, it will be created, if possible.

Since the function allocates one of the global filepointers, this call can fail
if there are no free file pointers. This stipulation makes it important that
the filepointer returned must be closed when finished with the file.

The filepath parameter must be set to a ten character array that is formatted
such that X:YYYYYYYY where X is the mount point and Y is a character in the
name of the file to open. If the filename is less than 8 characters, the
filename must be padded with \0.

Return Value -----------

Upon successful completion, fopen() returns a FILE pointer. If the file already
exists, the FILE->code will be set to FS_SUCCESS. If the file was created, the
FILE->code will be set to FS_SUCCESS_NEWFILE. Upon failure, NULL will be
returned.

The returned FILE will be initialized to point at the 0th byte of the file. A
buffer of the first sector of the file will be stored.

Errors -----------------

The following conditions will cause NULL to be returned:
+ The path to the file was invalid.
+ There were no available filepointers.
+ The file exists, but is already in use.

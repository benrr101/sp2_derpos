read_char() - DERP OS man page

Name -------------------
read_char() - Performs a blocking buffered IO request for a user.

Synopsis ---------------

#include "headers.h"

void read_char( char *buffer );

Description ------------

Provides a mean for doing "raw" input from the PS/2 keyboard.  A single
character is read each time along with a status byte of which modifier keys
(control, shift, and alt) are pressed. The status byte has the following
format, with the following bits set to 1 if the condition is true:
	Bit 1	-	Control key is pressed down
	Bit 2	-	Alt key is pressed down
	Bit 3	-	Shift key is pressed down
	Bit 4-7	-	Reserved
* Note: The reserved bits have no guaranteed value, it is highly recommend to
and off those bits when comparing the whole byte and not individual flags.

The buffer format is as follows: the first byte is the status byte, and the
second byte is the character that was read from the keyboard.  

The character that is returned is capitalized if shift was held down when the
character was typed.

Non-ASCII characters, such as escape, control, insert, etc will NOT cause
read_char to return.  The character the user types must be an ASCII character.

The modifier keys - control, shift, and alt - are set to 1 when either the 
left or the right modifier key is pressed.

buf		-	The array of characters to store the input.

Return Value -----------

Nothing.

Errors -----------------

Providing a bad buffer has undefined behavior.
